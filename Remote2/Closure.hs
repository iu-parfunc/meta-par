--   In spirit, this is actually:
--    
-- >   data Closure a where
-- >     Closure :: Serializable v => Static (v -> a) -> v -> Closure a     
--
--   where the Static type wraps a function with no non-static free variables.
--   We simulate this behavior by identifying top-level functions as strings.
--   See the paper for clarification.
