# See README.md for format description.
#
# Version: server 1.3
# 
# I'm attempting to keep track of changes to this config with the above.
# Note that changes to the benchmarks themselves also require changing
# this version number.  However, ADDING new benchmarks does not require 
# a version bump. 
# 
# CHANGELOG:
# 
# 1.2 - bringing up to date with benchlist.txt for paper.
# 1.3 - changed mandel implementation
