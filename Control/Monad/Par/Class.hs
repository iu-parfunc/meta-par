    This module establishes a class hierarchy that captures the
    interface(s) for valid Par monads.  In particular, the functionality
    is split into layers: for example Futures vs. full IVars vs. Chans (Streams).  

    Not all Par monad schedulers must provide all functionality.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- | @ParFuture@ captures the class of Par monads which support
--   futures.  This level of functionality subsumes "par/pseq" and is
--   similar to the @Eval@ monad.
class Monad m => ParFuture m future | m -> future where
  -- | Like 'fork', but returns a @IVar@ that can be used to query the
  -- result of the forked computataion.
  --
  -- >  spawn p = do
  -- >    r <- new
  -- >    fork (p >>= put r)
  -- >    return r
  --
  spawn  :: NFData a => m a -> m (future a)
  -- | Like 'spawn', but the result is only head-strict, not fully-strict.
  spawn_ :: m a -> m (future a)

  -- | read the value in a future (or @IVar@).  In the case of IVars,
  -- the 'get' can only return when the value has been written by a
  -- prior or parallel @put@ to the same @IVar@.
  get    :: future a -> m a

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- | @ParIVar@ builds on futures by adding full "anyone-writes, anyone-reads" IVars.
--   These are more expressive but may not be supported by all distributed schedulers.
class ParFuture m ivar => ParIVar m ivar | m -> ivar where
  -- | forks a computation to happen in parallel.  The forked
  -- computation may exchange values with other computations using
  -- @IVar@s.
  fork :: m () -> m ()
  -- | creates a new @IVar@
  new  :: m (ivar a)

  -- | put a value into a @IVar@.  Multiple 'put's to the same @IVar@
  -- are not allowed, and result in a runtime error.
  --
  -- 'put' fully evaluates its argument, which therefore must be an
  -- instance of 'NFData'.  The idea is that this forces the work to
  -- happen when we expect it, rather than being passed to the consumer
  -- of the @IVar@ and performed later, which often results in less
  -- parallelism than expected.
  --
  -- Sometimes partial strictness is more appropriate: see 'put_'.
  --
  put  :: NFData a => ivar a -> a -> m ()
  put v a = deepseq a (put_ v a)
  -- | like 'put', but only head-strict rather than fully-strict.
  put_ :: ivar a -> a -> m ()

  -- Extra API routines that have default implementations:

  -- | creates a new @IVar@ that contains a value
  newFull :: NFData a => a -> m (ivar a)
  newFull a = deepseq a (newFull_ a)

  -- | creates a new @IVar@ that contains a value (head-strict only)
  newFull_ ::  a -> m (ivar a)
  newFull_ a = do v <- new
                  -- This is usually inefficient! 
		  put_ v a
		  return v

  -- TODO: I think we should add yield officially:

  -- | Allows other parallel computations to progress.  (should not be
  -- necessary in most cases).
  --  yield  :: m ()


-- | @ParChan@ provides communication via streams of values between
--   computations in a Par monad.  Channels in this case are split
--   into separate send and receive ports.
--
--   The critical thing to know about @Chan@s in @Par@ monads is that
--   while the @recv@ method destructively advances the position of
--   the consumers "cursor" in the stream, this is only observable in
--   the local @Par@ thread.  That is, at @fork@ points it is
--   necessary to give the child a separate set of stream cursors so
--   that it observes the same sequences as the parent.
class ParChan m snd rcv | m -> snd, m -> rcv where
   newChan :: m (snd a, rcv a)
   recv    :: rcv a -> m a
   send    :: snd a -> a -> m ()

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Distributed operation:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- There doesn't seem to be a need to have a Future/IVar distinction here.
-- Rather, implementations will or will not make IVars serializable.
-- Likewise, some implementations will make the send ports of channels serializable.
-- (And perhaps they will allow an IVar to be converted to such a send port.)


#ifdef DIST_MONAD_PAR
-- | The @ParDist@ class supplies an interface for spawning parallel
--   computations that may potentially run on other machines.

  longFork  :: m () -> m ()
  -- longFork is only useful with an additional distributed IVar or Chan facility.
