data InclusiveRange = InclusiveRange Int Int

-- | Computes a binary map\/reduce over a finite range.  The range is
-- recursively split into two, the result for each half is computed in
-- parallel, and then the two results are combined.  When the range
-- reaches the threshold size, the remaining elements of the range are
-- computed sequentially.
--
-- For example, the following is a parallel implementation of
--
-- >  foldl (+) 0 (map (^2) [1..10^6])
--
-- > parMapReduceRangeThresh 100 (InclusiveRange 1 (10^6))
-- >        (\x -> return (x^2))
-- >        (\x y -> return (x+y))

-- except that the implementation will split the work into an
-- unspecified number of subtasks in an attempt to gain parallelism.
-- The exact number of subtasks is chosen at runtime, and is probably
-- a small multiple of the available number of processors.
--
-- Strictly speaking the semantics of 'parFor' depends on the
-- number of processors, and its behaviour is therefore not
-- deterministic.  However, a good rule of thumb is to not have any
-- interdependencies between the elements; if this rule is followed
-- then @parFor@ has deterministic semantics.  One easy way to follow
-- this rule is to only use 'put' or 'put_' in @f@, never 'get'.
